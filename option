# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol provides file sharing between an SMB
# server and an SMB client.  The the samba package includes an smbd daemon that
# provides an SMB server for Raspberry Pi OS and MacOS has a built-in SMB
# client.  smbd requires a configuration file named smb.conf located in the
# /etc/samba directory.  papamac's smb.conf is included in the bash-
# scripts package that has already been downloaded to the src sub-directory of
# the current working directory.  The option script copies this file to
# /etc/samba after saving the original file so that the original file can be
# restored by the remove script.
#
# option is designed to be used with p2pkg.  This can be done as part of a
# complete installation or separately.  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# sudo -E p2pkg -gio bash-scripts       # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from github and install it in the
#                                         HOME and current working directories.
#                                         Additionally, install smb.conf.
# sudo p2pkg -go bash-scripts           # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from github and install only
#                                         smb.conf.
# sudo p2pkg -o bash-scripts            # Install smb.conf from the existing
#                                         PWD/src/bash-scripts directory.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# The option script installs optional files for Raspberry Pi OS systems only.
# Do not use this script for a MacOS installations.  option must be run using
# sudo because it copies files into the root-owned directories.
