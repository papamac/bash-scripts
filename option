#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The Apple File Protocol (AFP) is implemented by the netatalk daemon in
# Raspbian.  The netatalk configuration is specified by the afp.conf file in
# the /etc/netatalk directory.  papamac's afp.conf is included in the bash-
# scripts package that has already been downloaded to the src sub-directory of
# the current working directory.  Option copies this file to /etc/netatalk
# after saving the original file so that the original file can be restored by
# the remove script.
#
# option is designed to be used with p2pkg.  This can be done as part of a
# complete installation or separately.  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# sudo -E p2pkg -gio bash-scripts       # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from github and install it in the
#                                         HOME and current working directories.
#                                         Additionally, install afp.conf.
# sudo p2pkg -go bash-scripts           # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from github and install only
#                                         afp.conf.
# sudo p2pkg -o bash-scripts            # Install afp.conf from the existing
#                                         PWD/src/bash-scripts directory.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# The option script installs optional files for Raspbian systems only.  Do not
# use this script for a Mac OS installations.  option must be run using sudo
# because it copies files into the root-owned directories.
