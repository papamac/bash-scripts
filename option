# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The option script installs optional files to run the netatalk and pigpio
# daemons on Raspbian systems.  These installations are sequestered into the
# option script (vs. being included in install) because they are omly
# applicable to Raspbian.  Do not use this script for a Mac OS installations.
#
# The bash-scripts package must be downloaded and installed before using
# option.  Before starting, option checks for this and aborts on failure.
#
# The Apple File Protocol (AFP) is implemented by the netatalk daemon in
# Raspbian.  The netatalk configuration is specified by the afp.conf file in
# the /etc/netatalk directory.  papamac's afp.conf is included in the bash-
# scripts package that has already been downloaded to the src sub-directory of
# the current working directory.  Option copies this file to /etc/netatalk
# after saving the original file so that the original file can be restored by
# the remove script.
#
# pigpio is a library for the Raspberry Pi written by Ben Nuttall to control
# the Pi 's General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) capabilities.  The pigpio
# library is implemented in a server utility that runs as a daemon
# (/usr/bin/pigpiod).  The bash-scripts pigpiod script statuses, starts, stops,
# and restarts the pigpio server daemon using the standard start-stop-daemon
# script.  option installs this script in /etc/init.d allowing the system
# initialization daemon to start/stop the pigpio server daemon during system
# startup/shutdown.  It also links the links the script for automatic startup
# on reboot and restarts the daemon to activate it in the current boot session.
#
# option is designed to be used with p2pkg.  This can be done as part of a
# complete installation or separately.  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# sudo -E p2pkg -gio bash-scripts       # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from github and install it in the
#                                         HOME and current working directories.
#                                         Additionally, install afp.conf and
#                                         pigpiod.
# sudo p2pkg -go bash-scripts           # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from github and install only afp.conf
#                                         and pigpiod.
# sudo p2pkg -o bash-scripts            # Install afp.conf and pigpiod from the
#                                         existing PWD/src/bash-scripts
#                                         directory.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# Before running option, netatalk must be installed using apt-get.  Also,
# option must be run using sudo because it copies files into the root-owned
# directories.
