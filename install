# DESCRIPTION:                                                                #

# The install script installs bash-scripts package files that have already    #
# been downloaded to the src sub-directory of the current working directory.  #
# Specifically, it copies src/bash-scripts/bash_aliases to .bash_aliases in   #
# the HOME directory, it marks the src/bash-scripts/p2pkg file as executable, #
# and it creates a symbolic link to p2pkg in the bin sub-directory of the     #
# current working directory.  Additionally, install creates HOME/bin if none  #
# exists.                                                                     #
#                                                                             #
# install is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Normally, the bash-scripts      #
# package is downloaded to the current working directory using ftp (-f) or    #
# git (-g) and then installed (-i).  If bash-scripts is to be installed in a  #
# root-owned directory, p2pkg -i must be executed using sudo.  Usage examples #
# are as follows:                                                             #
#                                                                             #
# p2pkg -fi bash-scripts                # Download the bash-scripts package   #
#                                         from the ftp server and install it  #
#                                         in the HOME and current working     #
#                                         directories.                        #
#                                                                             #
# cd /usr/local                         # Download the bash-scripts package   #
# sudo p2pkg -gi bash-scripts             from github and install it in the   #
#                                         HOME and /usr/local directories.    #
#                                                                             #
#                                                                             #
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:                                                   #

# When running install via p2pkg in a sudo environment, sudo -E must be used  #
# to preserve the user's HOME directory.  install checks for this and exits   #
# if $HOME is /root.  papamac's runtime environment (see bash_aliases)        #
# prevents this from happening by aliasing sudo to sudo -E.                   #
#                                                                             #
