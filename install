# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The install script installs bash-scripts package files that have already been
# downloaded to the src sub-directory of the current working directory.
# Specifically, it copies src/bash-scripts/bash_aliases to .bash_aliases in the
# HOME directory, it marks the src/bash-scripts/p2pkg file as executable,
# and it creates a symbolic link to p2pkg in the bin sub-directory of the
# current working directory.  Additionally, install creates HOME/bin if none
# exists.
#
# install is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Normally, the bash-scripts
# package is downloaded to the current working directory using ftp (-f) or git
# (-g) and then installed (-i).  If bash-scripts is to be installed in a root-
# owned directory, p2pkg -i must be executed using sudo.  Usage examples are as
# follows:
#
# p2pkg -fi bash-scripts                # Download the bash-scripts package
#                                         from the ftp server and install it in
#                                         the HOME and current working
#                                         directories.
# cd /usr/local                         # Download the bash-scripts package
# sudo p2pkg -gi bash-scripts             from github and install it in the
#                                         HOME and /usr/local directories.
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# When running install via p2pkg in a sudo environment, sudo -E must be used to
# preserve the user's HOME directory.  install checks for this and exits if
# $HOME is /root.  papamac's runtime environment (see bash_aliases) prevents
# this from hapening by aliasing sudo to sudo -E.
