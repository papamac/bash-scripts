# The remove script removes all bash-scripts files from the HOME and current  #
# working directories.                                                        #
#                                                                             #
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage examples are as follows:   #
#                                                                             #
# sudo p2pkg -r bash-scripts            # Remove the bash-scripts package     #
#                                         from the HOME and current working   #
#                                         directories.                        #
#                                                                             #
# cd /usr/local                         # Remove the bash-scripts package     #
# sudo p2pkg -r bash-scripts              from the HOME and /usr/local        #
#                                         directories.                        #
#                                                                             #
#                                                                             #

# When running remove via p2pkg in a sudo environment, sudo -E must be used   #
# to preserve the user's HOME directory.  remove checks for this and exits if #
# $HOME is /root.  papamac's runtime environment (see bash_aliases) prevents  #
# this from happening by aliasing sudo to sudo -E.                            #
#                                                                             #
