#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The remove script removes all bash-scripts files from the HOME and current
# working directories.  It also restores the original afp.conf file (if any) in
# /etc/netatalk.
#
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# sudo p2pkg -r bash-scripts            # Remove the bash-scripts package from
#                                         the HOME and current working
#                                         directories and restore
#                                         /etc/netatalk/afp.conf.
# cd /usr/local                         # Remove the bash-scripts package from
# sudo p2pkg -r bash-scripts              the HOME and /usr/local directories
#                                         and restore /etc/netatalk/afp.conf.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# Because it changes files and directories owned by root, p2pkg -r must be
# executed using sudo.  Also, sudo -E must be used to preserve the user's HOME
# directory.  remove checks for this and exits if $HOME is /root.  papamac's
# runtime environment (see bash_aliases) prevents this from hapening by
# aliasing sudo to sudo -E.
